I've been using Javascript and Jquery for a couple years now and I want to give AngularJS and Bootstrap a shot.
I believe a simple financial/budgeting tracker would be a good place to begin.

My goal for this application is to gain a better understanding of both AngularJs and Bootstrap.

I plan on having four parts to this application: Overview, Transactions, Analysis, and Settings.

Overview will be just that, an overview of your finances. A user will be able to see their total money, their total income, and their total expenese. 
Transactions will be an itemized list of all of the users income and expenses.
Analysis will use the information from income, expenses, total money and possibly categories of expense to graph the user's spendings.
Settings will contain general information about the application. [Need to outline this more].

I have only been working on this project for a couple of weeks. This is my progress thus far.
