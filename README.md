# angular-budget-app
My first attempt at making an AngularJS web application (with Bootstrap CSS)

I've been using Javascript and Jquery for a couple years now and I want to give AngularJS (and Bootstrap) a shot.

I believe a simple financial/budgeting tracker would be a good place to begin... hopefully.
