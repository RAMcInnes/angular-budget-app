TO DO

	- Use localStorage to save values in incomeList and expenseList
	- NOTE: localStorage cannot save Arrays, only Strings.
	
	- Link Profit, Income and Expense values to reflect values stored in incomeList and expenseList
	- For now, totalMoney will be a set value, but obviously will be changeable in the future.

	- Values($) in Financial View reflect saved transactions 

	- I would eventually like the Profit, Income and Expense 
		to switch between Yearly and Monthly displays
	- [BOOTSTRAP]
		- Make scalable for Mobile / iPAD
		- Clean up look
		- Color improvement
